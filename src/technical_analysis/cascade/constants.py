"""Shared constants for the NIFTY regime-aware precision cascade.

This package is the single source of truth for the cascade ENGINE and the
PROMOTED strategy roster. Two pipelines consume it:

  * backtest/vectorbt_research/build_experiment.py  â€” research harness; registers the FULL
    strategy roster (promoted + still-experimental) and writes the experiment
    artifacts (per-strategy CSVs, comparison.txt, base.txt).
  * src/technical_analysis/cascade/pipeline.py / scripts/daily_NIFTY â€” production;
    registers ONLY the promoted roster and emits the single final prediction.

The engine math (regime routing, labelling, precision-floor voting, scoring) is
identical for both; only the strategy roster differs, so the two pipelines can
diverge over time without the engine drifting.
