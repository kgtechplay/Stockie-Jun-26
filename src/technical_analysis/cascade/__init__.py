"""NIFTY regime-aware precision cascade â€” shared engine + promoted strategy roster.

Public API re-exported for convenience. Two pipelines consume this package:
  * the research harness (backtest/vectorbt_research/build_experiment.py), which registers
    the FULL strategy roster (promoted + experimental), and
  * production (src/technical_analysis/cascade/pipeline.py, scripts/daily_NIFTY),
    which registers ONLY the promoted roster.
Both share this engine; only the roster passed to `gather_regime_signals` differs.
